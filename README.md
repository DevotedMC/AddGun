### Add Gun
-------------

People keep telling me to "Add Gun". So fine, I'm adding it.

## The Basics
--------------

If you enable them in config, players can get guns using the following simple commands:

**/gun** -- presents a menu with all configured guns

**/clip** -- some guns aren't loaded directly, but via "clips" or magazines of bullets, this command brings up a menu to pick 'em

**/bullet** -- guns need bullets to fire, brings up a menu showing all configured bullets.

### Loading
-----------

To load bullets into guns or clips, pick up the bullets. While holding them, right click the clip, or gun, as indicated.

Pay attention to the lore on the gun / clip -- it'll tell you if it can hold the bullets you've picked up or not.

To load clips into guns, pick up the clip, and right click the gun. If a clip is already loaded, it will be swapped out with the one you are holding.

If you've "locked" a clip to a particular bullet type, but the clip is now empty, right click the clip with nothing in your hand, to "free it" for other
kinds of bullets.

### Repair
---------

Guns wear out, and will begin to misfire more often (potentially explosively!) as they are used. If enabled, type **/rgun** while holding the gun, to
fully repair it.

### Misfire
-----------

Some guns wear out quickly, others won't -- this depends on their health, and the "curve" settings for misfire chances (inflection and smoothness).

Pay attention to the gun, there will be a message in the lore indicating if the gun is wearing out. Some guns are just unreliable, and will come out
of the factory with some "wear" visible.

### Aiming
----------

Note: this section subject to change.

To aim any gun, a combination of stillness and crouching is necessary. This is to emulate " lining up your shot " in real life. If you don't take the
time to line up your shot, you'll likely miss your target -- often by a lot. Some guns have a nasty kick to them. Others are generally easily aimed. Again,
this is all controlled by configuration... In any case, crouch, to see a visual indicator of the quality of your aim. Wait for it to go green before shooting,
for best results.

### Damage
----------

All damage is fully custom and configurable. I'll explain more about that later.
